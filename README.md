![Walk cycle](https://github.com/cxong/cxong.github.io/blob/master/_posts/cdogs_walk_cycle_jones.gif)

[C-Dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Dogs) is a freeware DOS game made between 1997-2001 by Ronny Wester, who's also known for making Cyberdogs (1994). Although relatively obscure, it was one of the more well-known games of its kind, and built a small following with many fans creating custom campaigns for it. Players loved it for its simple yet addictive gameplay and wicked explosions.

The story would have ended there had Ronny not been awesome enough to release the source code in 2002. There it was picked up by Jeremy Chin and Lucas Martin-King, who ported the game to SDL and made it available for modern PCs. A few other ports came and went, for systems as varied as BeOS and Wii.

These days the project is maintained by Cong Xu, who along with a few other contributors, have been making the game even better while staying true to the original game's vision. 4-player multiplayer, co-op AI, moddability and new campaigns/maps are just some of the enhancements available.
